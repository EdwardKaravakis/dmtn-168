Introduction
============
The PanDA (Production ANd Distributed Analysis) is a workload management system for distributed (GRID
based), Cloud, or HPC computing. PanDA based setups usually include few leveraged components such as:

- PanDA server [PanDA_documentation]_, [PanDA_paper]_
- JEDI system [JEDI_twiki]_
- Harvester [Harvester_documentation]_, [Harvester_slides]_, [Harvester_paper]_
- Pilot [Pilot_documentation]_, [Pilot_paper]_
- iDDS [iDDS_documentation]_, [iDDS_slides]_
- Monitoring [monitoring_paper]_
- CRIC [CRIC_slides]_

All these components have a well-defined scope of functionality and its independent installation allows to manage deeply
customized instances.
For the year 2019, the ATLAS PanDA instance landed 394M computing jobs on 165 computation queues distributed all over
the World. There are more than 3000 users who use BigPanDA monitor. PanDA system has been successfully adopted by other
experiments, e.g. COMPASS [compass_paper]_.

In this note, we describe the PanDA setup created for Rubin evaluation and test data processing.

Setup
=====
We have intensively used results of both ATLAS Google POC [atlas_google_poc]_ and Rubin Google POC
[rubin_google_poc]_ projects. The following components of the setup were configured specifically for this exercise:

- **Harvester.** A Kubernetes edge service has been configured in the DOMA Harvester instance to handle two clusters
  deployed on the Google Kubernetes Engine. We distinguished all tasks in the workflow by memory requirements into two
  groups: high (16 GB per pod) and conventional memory (4GB per pod). Queues are functioning in the PULL mode. This mode
  continuously provided few instances of pilot idling in the GKE pods and periodically checked for new jobs. The number
  of running pilots and, accordingly, number of activated nodes dynamically increased to match the number jobs
  immediately ready submission on the a queue. Details of Harvester configuration for using Google Cloud Console
  described here [harvester_gke_manual]_.
- **Pilot.** It is a generic middleware component for grid computing. Instead of submitting payload jobs directly to
  the grid gatekeepers, pilot factories are used to submit special lightweight jobs referred to here as pilot wrappers
  that are executed on
  the worker nodes. The pilot is responsible for pulling the actual payload from the PanDA server and any input files
  from the Storage Element (SE), executing the payload, uploading the output to the SE, monitoring resource usage,
  sending the heartbeat signal, evaluation and sending the final job
  status to the PanDA server. Pilot jobs are started by pilot-starter jobs, which are provided by the Harvester.
  In the created setup pilot uploads the log files from produced by each job to a Google Bucket for long term storage.
- **iDDS.** This system provides synchronization of payload execution accordingly to the Direct Acyclic Graph
  (DAG) generated by BPS subsystem. Its basic role is to check payload processing status and resolve pseudo inputs
  in tasks successors once correspondent predecessor job has finished. PanDA plugin uses iDDS client to submit workflow
  and once it submitted iDDS sends the payload to PanDA server and manages its execution. iDDS provides API for
  workflow management as a whole such as cancellation, retrial.
- **Google Cloud configuration.**  As it was noted above we defined two kubernetes clusters with different type of
  machines: *n2-standard-4* with ~4 cores and ~4 GB of memory per core and *n2-custom-4-43008-ext* with ~4
  cores and ~16 GB of RAM per core. Part of each CPU power and memory are reserved by GKE for management purpose,
  this is why each machine can not accept more than 3 jobs. Disk size for all machines was set to 200 GB with ordinary
  performance type (not SSD). All nodes were preemtible and autoscaling was enabled for both clusters.
  Data is kept on the Google Storage and accessed using gc protocol. All payload executed in the
  Docker containers. We have deployed a Docker over Docker configuration with outer container responsible for providing
  the OSG worker node software stack for landing the Pilot and perform X.509 proxy authentication to communicate
  with PanDA server. The inner container contains the standard Rubin software published in the official DockerHub
  repository.

Where were additional improvements of JEDI and iDDS core but they were done into the workflow agnostic way.

PanDA Queues o GKE Clusters and GCS Buckets
===========================================

GKE Clusters
------------

In the project of *panda-dev-1a74*, we defined 5 kubernetes (GKE) production clusters
and one small GKE test cluster (**developmentcluster**). All clusters are deployed using correspondent [Terraform]_
configuration. The repository with deployment scripts are available in the LSST GitHub [deployemnt_project]_.

Currently there are 7 GKE clusters::

PanDA Queues
------------

There are 6 PanDA queues were configured in the [CRIC]_ system to match particular job requirements:

- **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST** (GKE cluster: **moderatemem**). This is a cluster for jobs that are not sensitive to node
  preemption
  and requiring not more than 3200MB of RAM. The GKE k8s cluster is configured to use *n2-standard-4* machines which
  offer 4
  cores with 16GB of total memory. These available CPUs and memory are shared between jobs assigned to particular nodes
  and system pods which performs the machine level health monitoring, logs delivery, events collection and another
  Kubernetes service functions. This is why the available computing power is reduced, and the value of 0.85
  core and 3200MB of RAM per job are
  experimentally proved values that allow fitting 4 jobs in every cluster node. That values are defined in the
  Kubernetes job definition YAML, which is used by Harvester in a job submission phase. This cluster lands the majority
  of jobs in Rubin's payload.
- **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_HIMEM** (GKE cluster: **highmem**). For jobs requiring more than 3200MB but less than
  18000MB of RAM, we defined a high memory preemption cluster. This cluster uses *n2-custom-4-43008-ext* machines and
  can land up to 2 jobs per one node. The machine choice was motivated by the following: the "ext" memory is higher
  priced than the standard one, and we can't order less than 4 cores for such an amount of memory. Further optimization
  is possible.
- **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_EXTRA_HIMEM**  (GKE cluster: **extra-highmem**). This is a queue for extremely
  memory-demanding jobs and allows them to allocate 224900MB of memory (there is some memory overhead from the kubernetes components). 
  If submitting task requests RAM above the
  **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_HIMEM** capability, the job becomes assigned to this queue.
- **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_MERGE** (GKE cluster: **merge**). This is a special queue to run merge jobs finalizing each
  submitted workflow. This queue has been excluded from the automatic PanDA brokerage, and tasks are assigned using
  the queue definition parameter in the Rubin BPS submission YAML. The distinguished property of the correspondent
  backend cluster is that number of concurrent jobs is very limited. This limitation allows controlling the number of
  active connections to the Butler Postgres DB.
- **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_HIMEM_NON_PREEMPT** (GKE cluster: **highmem-non-preempt**). We have experimentally observed
  that jobs lasting more than 12 hours have a low probability of success due to nodes preemption. This significantly
  impacts the duration of the workflow run because it takes a few days of running and failing attempts to reach the
  retry attempt, which will finally survive. That long-lasting retry attempts with a low survival rate also negatively
  impact the cost-efficiency. To increase the chances for such durable jobs to finish from the first attempt, we
  created a special non-preemptive queue. In terms of CPU and RAM, the queue is equivalent to the
  **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_HIMEM**.
- **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_EXTRA_HIMEM_NON_PREEMPT** (GKE cluster: **extra-highmem-non-preempt**). We have experimentally observed
  that jobs lasting more than 12 hours have a low probability of success due to nodes preemption. This significantly
  impacts the duration of the workflow run because it takes a few days of running and failing attempts to reach the
  retry attempt, which will finally survive. That long-lasting retry attempts with a low survival rate also negatively
  impact the cost-efficiency. To increase the chances for such durable jobs to finish from the first attempt, we
  created a special non-preemptive queue. In terms of CPU and RAM, the queue is equivalent to the
  **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_EXTRA_HIMEM**.
- **DOMA_LSST_DEV**  (GKE cluster: **developmentcluster**). This cluster is used for testing developments before
  deployment into the production environment.

The queues configuration files are available in the GitHub repository `the panda-conf github repo <https://github.com/lsst-dm/panda-conf/tree/master>`_.

The json file *panda_queueconfig.json* defined all PanDA queues on the harvester server. The *kube_job.yaml* provides
Kubernetes job configuration for **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_HIMEM**, **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_EXTRA_HIMEM**,
**DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_MERGE** queues. The *kube_job_moderate.json* defines K8s jobs on **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST** and
*kube_job_non_preempt.yaml* for **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_HIMEM_NON_PREEMPT** and **DOMA_LSST_GOOGLE_TEST_EXTRA_HIMEM_NON_PREEMPT**. The yaml file
*job_dev-prmon.yaml* is for the test queue **DOMA_LSST_DEV**.

The above "k8s_yaml_file" files instruct POD:

- what container image is used.
- what credentials are passed.
- what commands run in the container on the pod.

While the "k8s_config_file" files associate PanDA queues with their corresponding GKE clusters, which be explained in the next subsection.

For the production queues, the commands inside the container are passed to *"bash -c"*::

 whoami;cd /tmp;export ALRB_noGridMW=NO; wget https://storage.googleapis.com/drp-us-central1-containers/pilots_starter_d3.py; chmod 755 ./pilots_starter_d3.py; ./pilots_starter_d3.py || true

It will download `the pilot package <https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot2>`_ and start a new pilot job.

For debugging purpose, a POD node can be created independently with a test yaml file.
But a different metadata name should be used i.e. *test-job*, in the yaml file. For example::

 kubectl create -f test.yaml
 kubectl get pods -l job-name=test-job
 kubectl exec -it $podName -- /bin/bash

which creates a pod in the job-name of test-job, and enters to the container on that POD to debug, where $podName is
the POD name found on the command "*kubectl get pods*".

Association of PanDA queues with GKE Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to associate a new GKE cluster with the corresponding PanDA queue, a "k8s_config_file" file need to be created. Take an example of the cluster "**extra-highmem-non-preempt**"::

 export KUBECONFIG=/data/idds/gcloud_config_rubin/kube_extra_large_mem_non_preempt
 gcloud container clusters get-credentials --region=us-central1 extra-highmem-non-preempt
 chmod og+rw $KUBECONFIG


GKE Authentication for PanDA Queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The environment variable **CLOUDSDK_CONFIG** defines the location of Google Cloud SDK’s config files. 
On the harvester server machine the environment variable is defined in the file */opt/harvester/etc/rc.d/init.d/panda_harvester-uwsgi*.
during new wokers creation the harvester server needs to run Google cloud authentication command::

 gcloud config config-helper --format=json

To check which account is used in the Google cloud authentication, just run **gcloud auth list**::

 % gcloud auth list  
    Credentialed Accounts
 ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
 *       dev-panda-harvester@panda-dev-1a74.iam.gserviceaccount.com
         gcs-access@panda-dev-1a74.iam.gserviceaccount.com
         spadolski@lsst.cloud
         yesw@lsst.cloud

 To set the active account, run:
     $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`

The GKE authentication account has been changed to use the service account **dev-panda-harvester**.

To modify the active account, first run the Google cloud authentication "**gcloud auth login**", then run **gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`**. 

AWS Access Key for S3 Access to GCS Buckets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rubin jobs need to access the GCS butler bucket in s3 botocore, hence AWS authentication is required. The AWS access secret key is stored in he environment variables **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**.

Currently the AWS access key from the service account **butler-gcs-butler-gcs-data-sa@data-curation-prod-fbdb.iam.gserviceaccount.com** is used as show on `the interoperability setting page <https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings;tab=project_access?project=data-curation-prod-fbdb>`_ for the project *data-curation-prod-fbdb*. 

The AWS access key is passed to the POD nodes via `kubernetes secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_ in the *data* field which have to be **base64-encoded** strings. 
Then the AWS access key is passed as environment variables into the Rubin docker containers. 

GCS Buckets
-----------

In the Google Cloud Storage (GCS), we defined two buckets, **drp-us-central1-containers** and
**drp-us-central1-logging**, as shown below:

.. figure:: /_static/GCS_Buckets-in-Rubin.jpg
     :name: List of buckets in the project

The 3rd bucket in the name of "us.artifacts.*", was automatically created in the Google Cloud Build, to store the
build container images.

As the bucket name indicates, the bucket **drp-us-central1-containers** accommodate container image files, the
pilot-related files and panda queue configuration files. The other bucket **drp-us-central1-logging** stores the log
files of pilot and payload jobs.

The logging bucket is configured in *Uniform* access mode, allowing public access, and allowing a special service
account **gcs-access** with the permission of **roles/storage.legacyBucketWriter** and **roles/storage.legacyObjectReader**.
The credential json file of this special service account is generated in the following command::

 gcloud iam service-accounts keys create gcs-access.json --iam-account=gcs-access@${projectID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com

Where $projectID is *panda-dev-1a74*.  Then it is passed to the container on the POD nodes via the secret name
*gcs-access*, with the environmental variable **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL** pointing to the json file.

Job Run Procedure in PanDA
==========================

The PanDA system is overviewed in the following graph:

.. figure:: /_static/PandaSys.png
     :name: PanDA system overview

The detailed description of these components presented in the slides of
`PanDA status update talk <https://brookhavenlab-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/spadolski_bnl_gov/ERnBzu8NO0lHi57ZcS_ESkUBJGl_8qdpKVr4VvG2TICp0A?e=5vaCdw>`_.

Job Submission
--------------

As described in `the PanDA Orchestration User Guide <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J0Dxe_TJoIpWQm_izBY4Cz6mWkgLCVTZB6pZxkjS0Gg/view>`_,
jobs generated by the BPS subsystem end then grouped in into tasks by PanDA plugin using jobs labels as a grouping criteria.
In this way, each task performs the unique principal operations over different Data/Node ids. Each job has its own input
Data/Node id. The submission YAML file is described here: `configuration YAML file <https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/w_2021_24/modules/lsst.ctrl.bps/quickstart.html#bps-configuration-file>`_.
Once PanDA plugin generates a workflow of dependent jobs united into tasks it submits them into iDDS
performing transitional authentication in PanDA server.
`The PanDA monitoring page <https://panda-doma.cern.ch/tasks/>`_ will show the tasks in the status of *registered*, as shown below:

.. figure:: /_static/Jobs-registered.jpg
     :name: Registered PanDA jobs

Job Starting
------------

`The harvester server <https://github.com/HSF/harvester>`_, *ai-idds-02.cern.ch*, is continuously querying the PanDA
server about the number of jobs to run, then triggers the corresponding GKE cluster to start up the needed POD nodes.
this moment, those tasks/jobs status will be changed into *running*, as shown below:

.. figure:: /_static/Jobs-running.jpg
     :name: Running PanDA jobs

Job Running
-----------

The POD nodes run in the pilot/Rubin container, for example,
*us.gcr.io/panda-dev-1a74/centos:7-stack-lsst_distrib-w_2021_21_osg_d3*, as configured in the GKE cluster. Each jobs
on the POD nodes start one pilot job inside the container.
The pilot job will first get the corresponding PanDA queue configuration and the associated storage
ddmendpoint (*RSE*) configuration from CRIC.

The pilot job uses the provided job definition in case of **PUSH** mode, or will get retrieve definition in case of **PULL** mode.
Then the pilot job runs the provided payload job. In case of **PULL** mode, one pilot job could get and run multiple payload jobs one by one.
After the payload job finishes, the pilot will use
`the python client for GCS <https://googleapis.dev/python/storage/latest/index.html>`_ to write the payload job log
file into `the Google Cloud Storage bucket <https://storage.googleapis.com/drp-us-central1-logging/>`_, which is
defined in the PanDA queue and RSE configuration.
Then the pilot will update the job status including the public access URL to the log files, as shown below:

.. figure:: /_static/Jobs-done.jpg
     :name: Finished PanDA jobs

If the jobs have not finished successfully, the job status would be *failed*.

The pilot communication with the PanDA server is authenticated with a valid grid proxy,
which is passed to the container through POD. Similarly, a credential json file of the GCS bucket access service
account is passed to the container, in order to write/access to the GCS bucket in the python client for the
Google Cloud Storage.

Job Monitoring
--------------
Users can visit the PanDA monitoring server, `https://panda-doma.cern.ch/ <https://panda-doma.cern.ch/>`_, to
check the workflow/task/job status. The PanDA monitor fetches the payload information from the central database. The
monitoring provides the drill down functionality starting from a workflow and finishing by a particular job log.
Click on the task IDs will go into the details of each task, then click on the number
under the job status such as *running*, *finished*, or *failed*, will show the list of jobs in that status. You can
check each job details by following *the PanDA ID number*.

Real-time Logging
-----------------
The Rubin jobs on the PanDA queues are also provided with (near)real-time logging on Google Cloud Logging.
Once the jobs have been running on the PandDA queues, users can check the json format job logs on 
`the Google Logs Explorer <https://console.cloud.google.com/logs>`_.
To access it, you need to login with your Google account of **lsst.cloud**, 
and select the project of **"panda-dev"** (the full name is **panda-dev-1a74**).

On the Google Logs Explorer, you make the query. Please include the logName **Panda-RubinLog** in the query::

 logName="projects/panda-dev-1a74/logs/Panda-RubinLog"

For specific panda task jobs, you can add one field condition on **jsonPayload.TaskID** in the query, such as::

 logName="projects/panda-dev-1a74/logs/Panda-RubinLog"
 jsonPayload.TaskID="6973"

For a specific individual panda job, you can include the field **jsonPayload.PandaJobID**.
Or search for a substring "Importing" in the log message::

 logName="projects/panda-dev-1a74/logs/Panda-RubinLog"
 jsonPayload.TaskID="6973"
 jsonPayload.message:"Importing"

Or ask for logs containing the field *"MDC.RUN"*::

 logName="projects/panda-dev-1a74/logs/Panda-RubinLog"
 jsonPayload.TaskID="6969"
 jsonPayload.MDC.RUN:*

You will get something like:

.. figure:: /_static/Screenshot-GoogleLogsQuery-20211012.jpg
     :name: Example of Google Logs Query


You can change the time period from the top panel. The default is the last hour.

And you can also pull down the **Configure** menu (on the middle right) to change what to be displayed on the **SUMMARY** column of the query result. By default, it shows the content of *jsonPayload.message*.


There are more fields available in the query. As you are typing in the query window, it will show up autocomplete field options for you.

You can visit `the page of Advanced logs queries <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries>`_ for more details on the query syntax.

Support
==========
There are two lines of support: Rubin-specific and core PanDA components. For front line support we established a
dedicated slack channel: #rubinobs-panda-support. If an occurred problem goes beyond the Rubin deployment, a
correspondent development team could be involved. Support channel for each subsystem of the setup provided in
particular documentation.
